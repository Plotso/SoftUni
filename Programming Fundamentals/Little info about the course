This is the second course I went through in SoftUni. It showed me how to work with methods and clases , what is lambda  and LINQ , also 
how to work with matrixes... Furthermore we learned what are arrays , lists and dictionaries and how to use them which was basicly more
than 50% of our practical exam in the end of the course.
