This was the beginning of my programming journey :D ... I have practiced some simple codes at home like printing some text on the console or
doing some simple mathematical calculations ,which at the moment i though was something big,because reason :D .
So after that i enrolled for the beginning course in Software University (www.softuni.bg). The course is free and its purpose is
showing many motivated people what programming is and teaching us some simple codding stuff like : simple calculations , logical check ,
more complex logical check , loops , drawing (shapes) with loops and advanced loops. It is aiming towards helping us get some idea of what
programming is and whether we want to move forward with doing it. It was a long ,however,funny course which helped me to bounce into the programming life... After I completed the course with excellent score I was officially a student in SoftUni and my programming journey moved on...
